Got the Rasberry Pi to do something today, I can get data on the other computer and my next step I need to take is to get the data onto a graph

Tasks for the day (Febuary 9th, 2024):
    Write down the orignial function on the side of the graph (DONE)
    Make the graph look better (DONE)
    Figure how to make a scatter plot (DONE)
        ~To build on this, get a line of best fit for your plot (DONE)
        ~Display the function and derivative of line of best fit (DONE)

Note: Password for rasberry pi is: robots1234

Handy command to remember: (This command can pull the data after it is recorded)
scp pi@10.10.71.136:Documents/test.py /Users/denniscolombo/Documents
