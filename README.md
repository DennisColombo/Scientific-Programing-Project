    Write down the orignial function on the side of the graph (DONE)
    Make the graph look better (DONE)
    Figure how to make a scatter plot (DONE)
        ~To build on this, get a line of best fit for your plot (DONE)
        ~Display the function and derivative of line of best fit (DONE)

Tasks for the day (Febuary 23rd, 2024):
    Collect data from the rasberry pi and plot it (DONE)
    Figure out how to calculate the line of best fit for the data (DONE)
    Come up with a plan for tasks I need to accomplish in the future (DONE)
    Add some labels to help future me figure out what to do (DONE)

Tasks for the future:

Note: Password for rasberry pi is: robots1234

Handy command to remember: (This command can pull the data after it is recorded)
